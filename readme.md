# go-synthizer
A golang binding to the [synthizer](https://github.com/synthizer/synthizer) audio library.
## Status
This binding is not production ready yet, And there's a big possibility major buggs can be found, Since I'm new to go, So if you found any, Please submit an issue or a pull request if you would like to fix it you're self.
## What can we do now?
 - Initialize, With or without libraryConfig.
 - Creating context.
 - Creating generators, For now, Only streaming generator and it still misses some functionality.
 - Creating directSources.
 - Editing properties, Although untested and probably contains buggs.
